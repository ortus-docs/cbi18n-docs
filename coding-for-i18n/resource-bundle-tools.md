# Resource Bundle Tools

* A great utility for localization is [Attesoro](http://attesoro.org/), which can help you build your resource bundles. 
* Eclipse Resource Bundle Editor Plugin: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-rbe/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-rbe/) is another FANTASTIC editor for eclipse.
* IBM's [Resource Bundle Manager](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/rbmanager.jsp) which is awesome too.

Below you can see some screenshots of the eclipse resource bundle editor plugin. I really recommend this tool also
