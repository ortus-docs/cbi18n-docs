# Resource Bundle Tools

## JSON resource editors

* most code editors can be used for JSON editing, but if you have large resource files or many locales you can probably better use a specialized tool, which keeps track of missing translations
* [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) is a very capable and affordable resource editor, for both JSON and java properties. It can edit JSON flavours for vue and angular libraries and also has support for other resource bundle formats. However it can not convert between formats. Only conversion between flat and nested JSON files is supported.

## Java resource editors

* the Eclipse Resource Bundle Editor plugin is a FANTASTIC editor for eclipse: More info here [https://essiembre.github.io/eclipse-rbe/](https://essiembre.github.io/eclipse-rbe/)
* [Attesoro](https://attesoro.org/) is another free resource editor, a bit more limited and dated, but still usable.
* [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) is a very capable and affordable resource editor, for both JSON and java properties.

Below you can see some screenshots of the eclipse resource bundle editor plugin. I really recommend this tool.
